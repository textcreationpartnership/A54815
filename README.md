The moſt important of theſe Articles being manifeſtly oppoſite to the abſolute Monarchy of the Pope,
    _ CHAP. III. The only Rule of the Politick Church Government, is, its Felicity according to the Fleſh, in this World, and in the other, under the Authority of one ſole Monarch of the Univerſe, who is the Pope, of whom all his Chriſtian Kings are Tributaries and Subjects, and who hath, or ought to have for his Inheritance or Demean the Riches of all the World, whoſe Honours and carnal Pleaſures make the Churches Splendor and Felicity. Jeſus Chriſt hath merited them for her by the effuſion of his Blood, to render her Viſible, Perpetual, and Remarkable, as the moſt happy according to the Fleſh, of all other Republicks, that are, that ſhall be, or that ever were upon Earth.

      * ARTICLE I. According to our Cardinal, there is nothing more important for a Chriſtian, than to be a good Polititian; and it was to inſtruct Chriſtians in the Maxims of the True Policy, that the Cardinal undertook his Hiſtory of the Council of Trent: This Policy is that of the worldly wiſe, for the eſtabliſhing of which, Jeſus Chriſt preached the Goſpel, that he might teach men to be happy in this World and in the other.

Twenty Reaſons that prove the neceſſity of the Riches, Honours, and Voluptuouſneſs of the Church, to make thereof a Goſpel according to the Fleſh, the Vocation of all the World to Faith, and a part of that World to the Eccleſiaſtick Life, without which Riches Honours and Voluptuouſneſs, the Church having no Reputation among them who fancy thoſe things, would periſh, not being able to ſubſiſt happy, according to the Fleſh, if her Miniſters were poor, as formerly, and if they had not vaſt Riches, as the Glorious Cardinals, who are at this day the Pope's Courtiers: Here alſo ſhall be ſhewn the unluckineſs, the ſhamefulneſs, and even the

Vice of Poverty, whereof God in his Providence, is no Author, but Sin; or only Fortune, which on this ſcore, may be accuſed as the Enemy of Virtue.

      * ARTICLE I. According to our Cardinal, there is nothing more important for a Chriſtian, than to be a good Polititian; and it was to inſtruct Chriſtians in the Maxims of the True Policy, that the Cardinal undertook his Hiſtory of the Council of Trent: This Policy is that of the worldly wiſe, for the eſtabliſhing of which, Jeſus Chriſt preached the Goſpel, that he might teach men to be happy in this World and in the other.

The moſt important of theſe Articles being manifeſtly oppoſite to the abſolute Monarchy of the Pope,
    _ CHAP. V. Here are related the Twelve ordinary means, inriching the Court of Rome, and maintaining the ſplendor thereof, according to the fleſh, which is the act of all Religious Policy, the moſt pious, and the moſt important. The Twelfth and moſt efficacious of thoſe means, to teach every where the Goſpel according to the Fleſh, and this Religious Policy according to the Doctrine of Ariſtotle, to whom the Church is beholden for many Articles of Faith; is to eſtabliſh Colleges of Jeſuites, with power to ſet up the Inquiſition, and to be high Commiſſioners in that Holy Office; to make out proceſs againſt all them who ſhall differ from the ſentiments of that Philoſopher. And that theſe Jeſuites

ſhall have a general grant of all Privileges granted to the other Monaſtical Orders; although St. Bernard hath blamed thoſe privileges; for on the other hand they be approved by Nicholas Machiavel.

      * ARTICLE I. According to our Cardinal, there is nothing more important for a Chriſtian, than to be a good Polititian; and it was to inſtruct Chriſtians in the Maxims of the True Policy, that the Cardinal undertook his Hiſtory of the Council of Trent: This Policy is that of the worldly wiſe, for the eſtabliſhing of which, Jeſus Chriſt preached the Goſpel, that he might teach men to be happy in this World and in the other.

The moſt important of theſe Articles being manifeſtly oppoſite to the abſolute Monarchy of the Pope,
    _ CHAP. VI. Here be related the Intereſts and different ſentiments of the Catholick Chriſtian Crowns and Republicks, according as they are more leſs favourable to this ſame Religious Policy according to the fleſh. And tis made appear that there's none more oppoſite then thoſe of the Crown and of the Church of France, which propoſed no leſs at the Council of Trent, then to throw down the Churches Monarchy and Empire, and to take away the Splendour of the Court of Rome.

      * ARTICLE I. According to our Cardinal, there is nothing more important for a Chriſtian, than to be a good Polititian; and it was to inſtruct Chriſtians in the Maxims of the True Policy, that the Cardinal undertook his Hiſtory of the Council of Trent: This Policy is that of the worldly wiſe, for the eſtabliſhing of which, Jeſus Chriſt preached the Goſpel, that he might teach men to be happy in this World and in the other.
