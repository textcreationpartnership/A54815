            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NOthing appears to us with more diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage than when we have entertained our ſelves with great expectations of it; for all that we can attain in this world, muſt needs fall ſhort of thoſe fair Idea's we propoſe to our ſelves. There was never any Inſtance which did more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrate this, than the expectations from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> compared with the diſappointment that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, when the Iſſue of it was
<pb facs="tcp:31834:3"/>
found ſo diſproportioned to the hopes were conceived about it.</p>
            <p>When Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th. gave out his Thunders againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> he appealed to a free General Council; and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany</hi> that received his Doctrine, preſſed the Emperor much to procure one. This was a Popular thing; for from the Days of the Councils of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> it was univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> That Popes were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a General Council: but all that depended on the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> look'd on this as a thing of dangerous conſequence; yet till the matter were laid to ſleep, it was not fit to hold a General Council out of <hi>Italy,</hi> for there they were ſafe: and the Pomp of a reconciliation
<pb facs="tcp:31834:3"/>
with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, in the Council held at <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> through the Pageantry of which, an ill informed Age could not ſee, gave their Popes great credit; they were ſure of <hi>Italy,</hi> that nothing could miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in a Council that ſate on their ſide of the <hi>Alpes.</hi> This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſignally in the Council of <hi>Piſa,</hi> which <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. held againſt P. <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, where the people, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>French</hi> power, treated the Cardinals and Biſhops ſo ill, that they were forced to remove from thence to <hi>Millan,</hi> and there their reception was not much better. And as all feeble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts do confirm thoſe againſt whom they are made, ſo P. <hi>Julius</hi> drew great advantages from that oppoſition, by a Council which
<pb facs="tcp:31834:4"/>
he then held in the <hi>Lateran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the Demand, a Free Council, out of <hi>Italy,</hi> gave them no ſmall terror; the Riches and Greatneſs of their Court depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on ſo many Exactions, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations &amp; other Oppreſſions, that it had been preſumption to have expected that theſe things, for which nothing could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from Scripture or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhould have been defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or preſerved. It is true, the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> had no great reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any thing from a Council, nor is it to be imagined that they promiſed themſelves much from it. Generally all Biſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their Opinions, and they did ſo effectually beat down the Secular Intereſts of the whole Eccleſiaſtical State, that nothing but the force of Truth joyned
<pb facs="tcp:31834:4"/>
with great Sincerity, could bring over any Aſpiring or Dignified Church-men to their Party: So that how much ſoever the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might loſe in ſuch a Meeting, they were not like to gain much. But an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to it was plauſible; they knew the Pope would not be eaſily brought to it. Diviſions were like to follow between the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; the Clergy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Mountains; and they knew that there could be no hopes of a Council truly called: So that if ſuch a one were called, as former Councils had been, they would not want good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to juſtifie their declining theſe Judges.</p>
            <p>A General Council was a Demand which upon ſo urgent a neceſſity, a Pope knew not how
<pb facs="tcp:31834:5"/>
to deny, but they went about it with much caution. <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth carried too much of an Outlandiſh Simplicity with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty promiſed a Council, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed there had been many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Court, that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reformation, and ſet about it in good earneſt; but theſe Diſorders were not ſo eaſily cured, they were become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Court; ſo he made but ſmall progreſs. The Diſtemper was too inveterate to be ſoon removed. But if the Court was little edified with his Methods, they found his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor a man after their own heart: he was well taught in all the Arts of the Court, and knew how to diſſemble and diſguiſe things well, and was as dexterous in
<pb facs="tcp:31834:5"/>
turning about where his Intereſt led him, as could be; but it was not without difficulty that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways put off the motion for a General Council: He once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered one within <hi>Italy,</hi> but he knew the <hi>Germans</hi> would not accept of it. The Effect of theſe Delays was, That <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Doctrines got thereby more footing in <hi>Germany;</hi> for there was not ſuch a colourable pretence for proceeding againſt them, as a Deciſion of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council would have furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and the Emperor finding it neceſſary to cloſe that ſtarting-hole to which they always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves, at length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured one: To which, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops chiefly of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> went with very honeſt Deſigns, hoping to carry on with their
<pb facs="tcp:31834:6"/>
Determinations againſt Hereſie, ſome good Decrees for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; yet that they chiefly looked at, was to raiſe their own Dignity, and to beat down the ſwelled and uneaſie Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Papal Authority.</p>
            <p>But the Popes were too hard for them, and as they bridled their Mouths with the <hi>Proponen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus Legatis,</hi> by which no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be made but by the Legates, ſo by their Intrigues with Princes, by the penſions and preferments that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the Numbers of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, and the great Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Legats, Matters were ſo carried, that thoſe who called for that Aſſembly, ſuffered much by it, &amp; the Popes who were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apprehenſive of it, gained more by it, than by all the Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb facs="tcp:31834:6"/>
that ever they had had in the <hi>Lateran.</hi> The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Tenets were all condemned, and ſo there was now a better colour for proceeding againſt them. The Biſhops were much depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and at beſt made but <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of the Apoſtolick See,</hi> which did moſt effectually ſubject them to the Tyranny of that Court. Some Abuſes were put down; but thoſe were among the leaſt of theſe that were complained of, and the manner of putting them down, did prove the moſt infallible way of ſetting them up, with great advantage to the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> For in all theſe Condemnations the <hi>Prerogative of the Apoſtolick See was ſtill reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> by which they plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a Power in the Pope to diſpenſe with them;
<pb facs="tcp:31834:7"/>
and it was better for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of that Court thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, than to have given a full allowance for them, ſince theſe Decrees could have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect, but raiſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for Diſpenſations high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which it has ſince done ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, that ſoon after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Council, it was found that all the Diſeaſes under which the Patient long groaned, were now redoubled by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful or unskilful Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>It was no wonder then, if upon ſo great a Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every body deſired to ſee the ſecret Arts by which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſo ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed and turned ſo great an Engine; the <hi>Lutherans</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed all that their Intelligence brought them; but as that was
<pb facs="tcp:31834:7"/>
not much, ſo what came from them, was generally ſuſpected. The <hi>French</hi> being alſo diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome Decrees of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which were thought contrary to their King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and the Rights of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, took great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to theſe, and publiſhed the Inſtructions, Letters and Speeches of ſome of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors and Biſhops; but that was a lame account, and rather encreaſed than ſatisfied the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity people had.</p>
            <p>At length the Famous Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Council, written by Father <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> appeared; it was quickly carried beyond Sea from this City where it was firſt Printed, and put in many other Languages. The Style and way of writing was ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb facs="tcp:31834:8"/>
and maſculine, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues were ſo fully opened, with ſo many judicious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in all the parts of it, that as it was read with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo it was generally looked on as the rareſt piece of Hiſtory which the World ever ſaw. The Author was ſoon gueſſed, and that raiſed the eſteem of the Work; for as he was accounted one of the wiſeſt men in the World, ſo he had great oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to gather exact Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he had free acceſs to all the Archives of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> which has been now looked on for ſeveral Ages, as very exact, both in getting good Intelligence, and in a moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way of preſerving it; ſo that among their Records, he muſt have found the Diſpatches of
<pb facs="tcp:31834:8"/>
the Ambaſſadors and Prelates of that Republick that were at <hi>Trent,</hi> which being ſo near them, and the Council being of ſuch high conſequence, it is not to be doubted but there were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and particular Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both of more publick Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions and ſecreter Intrigues tranſmitted thither. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo contracted a cloſe Friendſhip with <hi>Camillus Oliva,</hi> that was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to one of the Legates, from whom he had many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Practices of the Legates, and of their correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Memorials and Notes of ſome Prelates that were at <hi>Trent,</hi> which he had gathered together.</p>
            <p>His Work came out within Fifty Years of the Concluſion of
<pb facs="tcp:31834:9"/>
the Council, when ſeveral who had been preſent there, were ſtill alive, and the thing was ſo recent in mens Memories, that few thought a man of ſo great Prudence as he was, would have expoſed his Reputation by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſuch a nice matter, things which he could not juſtifie; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there a man more hated by the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> than he was, and now he was at their mercy if he had abuſed the World by ſuch Falſhoods in matter of Fact as have been ſince charged on his Work; but none appeared againſt him for Fifty Years. The things were of ſuch importance to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that every body concluded their concern in the Matter, as well as their hatred of the Author would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb facs="tcp:31834:9"/>
them to write againſt a Book that had repreſented an Aſſembly which they called an Holy Oecumenical and General Council, whoſe Canons were to be received as a certain Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Faith, to be but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of cunning and ignorant men, who many times under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not ſo much as the debates of the Friars that opened the Canons which they were to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: That all was guided by Faction and Intrigue; That the Legates took from them all the Freedom of any ordinary Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; That the honeſt Motions of ſome zealous perſons were alwaies check'd and ſuppreſſed; That all Attempts at a true and effectual Reformation were cruſhed; That they went on ſlowly or ſpeedily as it ſerved

either the Emperor's Turn, or the Pope's Ends; That under a pretence of finding a Temper to reconcile Differences, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Words were put in their Decrees, which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perverted to ſuch Senſes as did defeat all the good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of ſome there; and in a word, a man ſhall find a great deal of Art and dextrous cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Shufflings and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Legates; but for any thing of Sincerity, or that ſavoured of men that ſought the Truth, and depended on God for the direction of his Spirit, to which they pretended ſo highly, there is not ſo much as an appearance of it to cheat any body with, though he had ever ſuch a mind to be couſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31834:10"/>Nor was it to be wondered, that thoſe whom they called Hereticks, did not acquieſce in the Decrees of ſuch a Meeting, which a Writer of their own Communion had ſo expoſed, that every good Catholick (as they call them) knew not how to defend it any other way but by that common and cheap Anſwer, That theſe were the Lies and Forgeries of a diſcontented Friar, who either out of Faction or Intereſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to diſgrace the Church. This was eaſily ſaid, and very hardly anſwered; for though it was not reaſonable to reject a Hiſtory that had ſo many Appearances of Truth in it, without other Reaſons but that unconquerable one, That they would not believe it, becauſe it
<pb facs="tcp:31834:11"/>
liked them not; yet they were ſafe in this Incredulouſneſs, and there was no driving them from it, till at length Cardinal <hi>Palavicini</hi> with great Art and much Induſtry, did in a moſt infallible way give a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inſtead of a confutation of that Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Work lay Fifty years at quiet in the poſſeſſion of the Belief of all that were diſintereſſed; and though ſome Writers of the Court-party were now and then pecking at it, yet none durſt take it to task. They could not pretend they deſpiſed it; for the credit it was in, ſet it beyond that. At length one undertook it; but dying before he had made any great progreſs, the Cardinal entered the Field, and that he
<pb facs="tcp:31834:11"/>
might attain the Purple upon Merit, reſolved to vindicate the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the former Hiſtorian. It was indeed ſafe to write at ſo great a diſtance, when the Third Generation from that Council was going off the Stage, ſo that whatever a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for Preferment, who could varniſh all he ſaid with fair and ſpecious colours, wrote of Tranſactions that were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a hundred years ago, vvas like to be vvell received, and at leaſt few could upon authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical grounds diſprove it; and ſuch of Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Friends, as perhaps knevv from vvhence he drevv his Informations, and could go to them again, were alſo dead: So that here lay a
<pb facs="tcp:31834:12"/>
great and juſt prejudice againſt the Cardinal's Work.</p>
            <p>There was too much Art and Varniſh in his Stile, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with too many ingenious Apologies for things that could not be denied; this muſt needs make the Reader ſee that his Deſign in writing, was not to tell the Truth, but to defend his Church. So that he is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be looked on as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſt than an Hiſtorian. It is true, on ſome occaſions he makes bold with Popes, and not without affectation cenſures their Actions; but this is a common Artifice, to ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous in leſſer matters, that upon greater occaſions one may cozen others with a witneſs: yet thoſe that read him, will find that he is very cautious in
<pb facs="tcp:31834:12"/>
his cenſures, and takes great care not to blame any of the former Popes, for the faults that were too apparent in his Patron P. <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this one that lived in <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, has publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very pleaſant thing. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> did the firſt years of his Reign declare loudly againſt a <hi>Nipotiſmo;</hi> and had ſolemnly ſworn that he would never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Kindred into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor ſo much as bring them to <hi>Rome;</hi> but when Fleſh and Blood grew too ſtrong for theſe Reſolutions, he made a ſhift to ſatisfie his Conſcience about his Oaths, and brought them to <hi>Rome,</hi> and put the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in their hands; which they managed with as many ſcandalous exceſſes as any had done
<pb facs="tcp:31834:13"/>
who had gone before them in that nearneſs to the infallible Chair. But before this was done, the firſt Volume of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Hiſtory was finiſhed; and in it he had laid moſt of the faults of former Popes on their raiſing their Families and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and putting the Affairs of the Church in their hands: and all this tended to raiſe the eſteem of his Patron, who had reſolved to root out that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, from whence all the reſt ſeem'd to be derived; yet the Volume was not publiſh'd when the Pope had brought his Family to <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore <hi>Palavicini</hi> finding that what he had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet out for the Pope's Honour, would tend to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and would alſo draw the Indignation of his Family
<pb facs="tcp:31834:13"/>
upon himſelf, ſuppreſſed that whole Impreſſion, and printed that Volume over again, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out all the ſevere reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had made on a Pope's raiſing his Family.</p>
            <p>He vouches his Relations from the Memorials of many of the Prelates and Friars that were at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which, he ſays, are to this day preſerved; and tells in what Libraries they are to be found, and offers very fairly full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all perſons, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a further information about them. If theſe were lying in <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> or any other indifferent place, ſome would perhaps adventure to examine theſe Vouchers; but few will hazard on it at <hi>Rome.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is untoward Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb facs="tcp:31834:14"/>
got into the minds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they are not over-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous at <hi>Rome.</hi> The forging of the Decretal Epiſtles, and the Donation of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, with many other things, has given the World ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt what they bring forth of that nature, that few will give credit to things that tend much to the advantage of that See, and are diſcovered at <hi>Rome,</hi> when men think they both lie for God and his Vicar, and for Preferment too, it will be hard to reſtrain them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they be of an <hi>Italian</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and of Jeſuits principles; which, to ſay no worſe, are not very ſevere in the matter of Candor and Sincerity. We know what a Trade the Monks and Friars drove many Ages
<pb facs="tcp:31834:14"/>
by Lies and Forgeries. If any thing might either raiſe the honour of their Order, or of the Houſe wherein they lived, a miraculous Story was firſt contrived, and either a Writing or ſome Relick was laid under ground, and then another dreams a Dream, that ſuch a Saint ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him, and told him to dig in ſuch a place for ſuch a thing: This being publiſhed, with great ceremony they made a ſolemn Search, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Rabble were thus cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is ſaid of Thieves and Robbers, who have driven the Trade long, that even after they are diſcovered, and in the Jayl, they cannot give it over, but muſt be ſtill practiſing their old Arts. So <hi>Rome</hi> has been ſo long uſed to Forgeries, that
<pb facs="tcp:31834:15"/>
after all the Diſcoveries that are made, they cannot hold their hands; and this in a great part leſſens the Authority of thoſe Journals and other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials that have been hid and unknown about a hundred years, and at length have appeared to ſerve a turn.</p>
            <p>But there are two things in the Cardinal's Work, which have given great advantages to thoſe who are not much diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to any high eſteem for that Council. The one is, That though in ſome circumſtances, and leſs material things, he has ſaid much to ſhew that Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Informations were not juſt nor exact, yet upon the matter he repreſents the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions as full of Intrigues, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices and Faction, as the other
<pb facs="tcp:31834:15"/>
did; only with this Difference, That Father <hi>Paul</hi> laid the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt load upon the Legates and the Court-Party, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> lays it ſometimes on the one, ſometimes on the other Faction; but generally on the Party that was for Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In a word, no man that is not quite blinded with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, can think, after he has read the Cardinal's Hiſtory, that the Holy Ghoſt had any ſpecial influence on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Vote in that Council; and it is as eaſie for a man to believe that the Succeſs of a Seſſion of Parliament, and thoſe Acts that are carried by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Prince, the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and dexterity of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the zeal and induſtry of ſome Patriots, flow from the
<pb facs="tcp:31834:16"/>
ſpecial direction of the Holy Ghoſt, as that the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> according to <hi>Palavicini</hi>'s Relation, was conducted by the Infallible Spirit of God, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Canons and Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for we plainly ſee the ſame Intrigues and Practices, the ſame Arts, either to take off, or ſatisfie the oppoſite party, and the ſame Conduct and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in the one that is in the other. The Reſolving the Houſe in a Grand Committee, was the ordinary practice of that Council; for a General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was the Council in a Grand Committee, and this was an excellent Demonſtration of the Legates great Diſtruſt of the Holy Ghoſt: For they would never put any thing to the hazard of a Vote in a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb facs="tcp:31834:16"/>
till they were ſure of it, by putting it to the Vote in a Congregation; and if it went not there as they had a mind it ſhould be, then they were to practiſe a little longer, till they had made the major Vote ſure; and then when it paſſed in a Congregation, the Legates held a Seſſion. He would be looked on as a man of great extravagance, who would ſtudy to impoſe on any body that is acquainted with the Methods of holding Parliaments, That there is any other Direction of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit than that Univerſal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that watcheth over and orders all humane Actions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying or governing their Proceedings. Men are not ſo tame as to ſuffer ſuch Miſtakes to paſs, and he that would make
<pb facs="tcp:31834:17"/>
uſe of his Wit or Eloquence, to perſwade any to ſuch an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, would be ſo generally cried down, that people would not hear him in patience.</p>
            <p>What muſt we then judge of thoſe who would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was infallibly directed, when we plainly ſee by the Hiſtorian of their own Court, that it was managed with the ſame ſecret motions and ſprings, by which other Princes carry what they deſire from the Aſſemblies of their ſeveral States? and I dare ſafely challenge any that has read that Hiſtory, to ſhew me any ſtep or motion that is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from all other Secular Councils, or that does not clearly ſhew that they not only did not expect an infallible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb facs="tcp:31834:17"/>
but knew they had it not; and therefore were to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that defect by other Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Arts; and it is an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well worthy of a Jeſuit's Candor, to perſwade the World that the Holy Ghoſt was among them, when their own deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhews they themſelves knew there was no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>There is another Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Cardinal's Hiſtory, which is the chief Subject of the following Reflections, That he knowing moſt of the abuſes in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which from thence have ſpred over their whole Church, were things that could not be denied; and that it was no leſs evident that all the Decrees about Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, made at <hi>Trent,</hi> have
<pb facs="tcp:31834:18"/>
been ever ſince neglected by the Popes, goes about the excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that which he could not deny.</p>
            <p>The Scheme he lays down is this, That <hi>Chriſt deſigned a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Monarchy in his Church: That men being but a compoſition of Fleſh and Blood, we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any high Reformation, nor raiſe things to that pitch, that only holy and good men will enter into the Service of the Church: That to maintain this Monarchy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Great perſons into the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Church, there muſt be vaſt Dignities and great Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: That theſe muſt be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome things, that taking things ſimply ſeem corruptions; but as men are, muſt be not only born with, but encouraged; therefore</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:31834:18"/>
Non-reſidences, Pluralities, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations, Indulgences, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Exemptions, <hi>with a Thouſand other Abuſes in the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, muſt ſtill be kept up, ſince they are neceſſary for bringing in that Revenue which muſt ſupport the Monarch of the Chriſtian Church, and his Princes, the Cardinals; who, if they lived in the ſimplicity and poverty of the firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, could not attract that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and Reverence from a Carnal World, which keeps up their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Authority. It is true, Chriſt and his Apostles took other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and by their wonderful Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and conſtant Labours, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel: But the Church was then in its Infancy, and needed Milk; but now that it is grown up to a full Age, it requires ſtronger Food, and Motives that prevail more
<pb facs="tcp:31834:19"/>
on the Appetites and Intereſts of frail men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It were to be wiſh'd that good things were well done, and that the Church were cleanſed from all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes; but theſe are the</hi> Idea's <hi>of Speculative perſons, who know not men, and underſtand not Buſineſs; and therefore all Reformations that are not practicable, and cannot well conſiſt with mens corrupt Intereſts, are to be rejected; and thoſe who promote them, are either weak, though zealous, or factious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſons, who deſign to beat down the Greatneſs of the Papal Monarchy, by withdrawing from it thoſe neceſſary Supports.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may not ſuch a Scheme of Maxims be well called a <hi>New Goſpel,</hi> proceeding from New Lights? This the Witty and Judicious Author of the
<pb facs="tcp:31834:19"/>
following Reflections, thought was ſo great an injury to that Church of which himſelf was a Member (being as I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, of the <hi>Sorbon</hi>) that he would needs expoſe it; which he thought might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done by bringing the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Maxims under ſome Heads, and laying them together, with the Conſequences that naturally flow from them, than by any laboured or learned Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. And indeed they do at firſt view diſcover ſuch an oppoſition to the Spirit of Chriſt, and the Goſpel, that no man who has a right taſte of the one, but muſt ſee it in the other.</p>
            <p>The Reader will be eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge whether a Church founded upon, and governed
<pb facs="tcp:31834:20"/>
by ſuch Maxims, be liker to be a <hi>Babel</hi> raiſed up, and carried on by humane Arts and carnal Policy, or a <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> built on the Foundation of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And indeed the Cardinal has fully ſatisfied us, That whatever reſpect the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends for Tradition, and the Doctrine of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, that is only becauſe they think in ſome points of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to have the better of the Proteſtants with that Weapon, yet in their hearts they deſpiſe the Rules &amp; Opinions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the fond conceits of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in Childhood, &amp; far ſhort of their Refinings in Policy; and therefore though there are many things practiſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged among them, which the Ancients not only knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:31834:20"/>
of, but hated with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect abhorrency; yet their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents are not of ſufficient Authority to make them throw out any thing that brings them in advantage; and any Objection from the Fathers, get no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Anſwer than this, That the Church was then but in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; but as ſhe grows older, ſhe becomes wiſer than Chriſt or his Apoſtles were. Theſe are excellent Arguments to perſwade men to hold the Deciſions of that Council, or the Practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court in high eſtimation. In all this <hi>Palavicini</hi> was much to be pitied; for both by other parts of that Work, and ſome other of his Treatiſes, it ſeems he had good Notions both of Virtue and Devotion; but
<pb facs="tcp:31834:21"/>
it was his Misfortune to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a Work which could not be finiſhed without touching it in ſeveral places with ſuch a Pencil.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved of men bred all their Life in Schools or Cells, who have never gone without their Precinct, nor converſed in the wide World, That when they appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, they mix their Works or Diſcourſes with many Conceits which they think witty and fine, but appear extravagant, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and ridiculous to the World, who vouchſafe them no better Name than Pedantry. So fares it with one bred at or about <hi>Rome</hi> all his Life, where the Abuſes of that Court, through a long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, are legitimated, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily coloured over with ſome
<pb facs="tcp:31834:21"/>
ſlight excuſe, which paſſes there, becauſe either men dare not ſpeak out what they think, or the want of Eccleſiaſtical Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and of a deep ſenſe of the Paſtoral Charge, makes them ſoon ſatisfied with any Anſwer, ſince they underſtand not the weight and force of the Objections that lie againſt thoſe Abuſes. But whatever opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch things may have about <hi>Rome,</hi> when they once paſs the Mountains, and are ſeen by men more diſintereſſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, they appear ſo fooliſh and childiſh, that no man needs to be at the pains to confute them; it is enough to read or hear them.</p>
            <p>The following Diſcourſe was with much care ſuppreſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, yet found its way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:31834:22"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> and fell into the Hands of one who was ſo Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, as to oblige the Nation, by putting it into their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: His Tranſlation as far as I have compared it, is exact and true; the only Fault that I found in it, is from his great care to be faithful, which has made him follow the <hi>French</hi> phraſe too near in ſome Paſſages: But for a Tranſlater, this is to err on the ſafer ſide.</p>

               <head>The Deſign and Partition of the Work.</head>
               <p>THis Work is divided into ſix Chapters. In the firſt, by the Cardinal's own Words will appear the Neceſſity, the Utility, the Nature, and the Excellency of that ſame Religious Policy which renders men happy in this world and in the other.</p>
               <p>This Policy, to be true, ought to be, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and according to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31834:26"/>
Fleſh, which diſtinguiſhes it from the falſe Policy of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that's pure Tyranny; and from the indiſcreet and ſcrupulous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of certain zealous and weak Ignorants, who not believing that one may be happy in this world and in the other, carry the Virtue <hi>Policy</hi> into the exceſs of an ideal and extravagant Reformation, as Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the 6th would fain have done, who in ſooth was a moſt ſpecial Prieſt, but a very ordinary Pope; <hi>Ottimo Eccleſiaſtico, Pontifice mediocre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Second Chapter are related and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed five general Maxims of thoſe zealous and ſcrupulous Ignorants who pretend that Religious Policy ought to found the Rules of its governing upon that which ſhould be according to God, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which may be agreeable to the Fleſh in the ſtate of corrupt Nature, and who believe that what is beſt to be done, is alſo beſt to be commanded; following Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Councils and the Vote of a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of private Biſhops, which theſe zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous people regard as little Kings <hi>Il volgo de' Rè,</hi> and as ſo many ſmall Popes in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſes <hi>à guiſa di Papi;</hi> whereas by Rules of the Policy indeed, the Pope cannot conſider them otherwiſe than as little Biſhops, <hi>picci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oli Veſcovi;</hi> Babies, <hi>Fanciulli;</hi> indiſcreet Zealots, <hi>per indiſcrezione di zelo;</hi> Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, <hi>impertinenti;</hi> Inſolent, <hi>inſolenti;</hi> Buffoons, <hi>i Buffoneſchi;</hi> in a word, unruly headſtrong Coach-horſes, ſtill ready to run
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31834:26"/>

               <p>In the Third, will be made evident, that the only Rule for politickly Governing the Church, is its felicity according to the Fleſh in this World, and in the other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Authority all-puiſſant of a King, ſole Monarch of the whole Univerſe, who is the Pope, <hi>Signore del Mondo;</hi> of whom all his Chriſtian Kings are Tributaries and Subjects; <hi>Molti Regni al loro Monarcao;</hi> whoſe Revenue is made up of the riches of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; <hi>avendo per patrimonio le ſuſtanze de' ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti;</hi> &amp; whoſe Honours and Pleaſures make the ſplendor &amp; carnal Felicity of the Church. That Jeſus Chriſt hath merited this Church by the effuſion of his Blood, to render it viſible, perperual and remarkable, as the moſt happy according to the Fleſh, of all other Republicks that are, that ſhall be, or ever have been upon Earth; <hi>questo governo diſegnato da' Chriſto più felice che ſia in terra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Fourth, will be alledged Twenty Reaſons proving the neceſſity of the Riches, Honours and Voluptuouſnes of this Church, to make thereof a Goſpel according to the Fleſh, and a Vocation of all the World to her Faith, and part of that World to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31834:27"/>
Eccleſiaſtick State: Without which Riches, Honours and Voluptuouſneſs, the Church, having no reputation among them who fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thoſe things would periſh, not being able to ſubſiſt happy according to the Fleſh, if her Miniſters were poor as formerly, and if they had not vaſt Riches, as the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cardinals, who at this day are the Pope's Courtiers; <hi>Glorioſi Cardinali.</hi> Here alſo ſhall be ſhewn the unluckineſs, the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, yea, and even the Vice of Poverty, whereof God in his Providence is no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but Sin, or only Fortune, who on this ſcore may be accuſed as the Enemy of Virtue; <hi>poter' accuſar la Fortuna come ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica della virtù.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Fifth, will be related the Twelve moſt ordinary Means to enrich the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to maintain the Splendor thereof according to this World, which is the moſt important and the moſt pious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the <hi>Religious Policy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Twelfth and moſt effectual of theſe Means is the eſtabliſhing of Colleges of <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> to teach the New Goſpel, and this ſame <hi>Religious Policy,</hi> all according to the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> with power for them to ſet up the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and to be High Commiſſioners in that Holy Court, making out Proceſs againſt all them who ſhall differ from the Sentiments of that Philoſopher. And over and beſides, with a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to them of all the Priviledges grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31834:27"/>
to the other <hi>Religious Orders,</hi> although found fault with by S. <hi>Bernard, Non ſodiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fece pienamente à San' Bernardo;</hi> becauſe on the other ſide they are approved by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel, per Confeſſione dello ſteſſo</hi> Nicolo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavelli.</p>
               <p>In the Sixth, will be diſcourſed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and the different Sentiments of the Catholick Chriſtian Crowns and Republicks, in relation to this ſame <hi>Religious Policy,</hi> according as they are more or leſs favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or oppoſite thereunto, it will be made apparent that there is none of them more oppoſite than thoſe of the Crown and of the Church of <hi>France; la qual tendeva ad abbatre la Monarchia e levar lo ſplendore e l'imperio della Corte Romana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Concluſion will be, That the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Trent</hi> ought to be taken and interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the ſenſe and meaning of this ſame <hi>Religious Policy</hi> according to the Fleſh, that makes men happy in this world and in the other, not in the ſenſe and meaning of thoſe zealous Ignorants, who would have all obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that is ordain'd by that Council, &amp; would thereby eſtabliſh their Ideal Reformation. But in the ſenſe and meaning of thoſe who would follow the Doctrine of this our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal; according to which, by leaving to the Pope full and whole power in the Shop or Office of <hi>Diſpenſations, Sopra la bottega di diſpenſazioni,</hi> to grant them as he pleaſes, and even to derogate from the Canons, it will clearly be ſeen, that that Council
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31834:28"/>
brings incomparably, more advantages to the Church, than the Hereſie either of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> have cauſed Loſſes or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs to it; <hi>maggior accreſimento di bontà per mezzo del Concilio che non fù ſcemato dell'iſteſſa Ereſia;</hi> becauſe being taken in that ſenſe, it teaches men a Policy and a Goſpel according to the Fleſh, with the means to be happy in this World and in the other. This will be henceforward, as our Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal promiſes to himſelf, an invincible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Catholick Religion againſt all the Hereticks, Infidels and Atheiſts who may have the preſumption to write againſt it, or againſt the <hi>Council of Trent:</hi> For it can be no longer doubted but that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt aſſiſted in a ſpecial manner at that Council, to hinder that it ſhould ordain nothing but what might be profitable to the Church; the Hereticks themſelves ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken up and owned thoſe words of Monſieur <hi>de Lanſac,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, which are ſince become ſo famous throughout the World; That the Pope ſent every day from <hi>Rome</hi> the Holy Ghoſt to <hi>Trent</hi> in a Cloak-bag; <hi>Lo Spirito Santo venia portato nella valigia:</hi> For, though at firſt bluſh theſe words ſeem impious, yet by means of the Scholaſtick interpretation that this Cardinal beſtows upon them, he makes ſubtilly to appear that their ſenſe is exactly true, ſolid, Catholick, and that there are no longer any but Ideots that are able to perceive in thoſe words any ſhadow
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31834:28"/>
or appearance capable to ſtartle their weak and ignorant Devotion. Lo how it hath ſteaded the Cardinal to have paſſed a Maſter in School-Divinity, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and Lo wherein this Philoſophy is profitable to the Church! for he that knows well how to handle it, turns againſt the Hereticks themſelves the Shot which they thought to diſcharge againſt her. And in fine, from what they ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt was ſent by the Pope in a Cloak-bag to that Council, one proves the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt in that Council; ſo then the Hereticks muſt own they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. And whoſo does not approve the Government of the Church, ſuch as it is this day under the Pope's Royalty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of this our Cardinal's Policy, muſt manifeſtly be either a Fool or a Seducer; <hi>Chi per approvare una forma di Republica non ſi contenta di queſto, ò è in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſano, ò è ſeduttore.</hi> And ſo all good reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Politick Chriſtians ought to pray God, quoth the Cardinal, that it would pleaſe him to cauſe the Spirit of S. <hi>Peter</hi> to live ſtill in all his Succeſſors, as it lives now at this day in him that reigns. <hi>Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hino Iddio che faccia vivere ſtabilmente com' oggi vive lo Spirito di San' Piedro</hi>

Surely no: So then we ought to conclude, that Jeſus Chriſt hath fitted his Church with ſuch a Government that there can be none imagined more conform to humane Felicity after the wiſh of the worldly wiſe, and after the Fleſh. Now it is certain, that the deſire of all after the Fleſh, is to be happy in this world as well as in the other; ſo then conformably to this Wiſh hath Jeſus Chriſt formed his Church; <hi>Che Chriſto hà formata la ſua Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa in quel modo eti' è più conforme eziandio all'umana felicità.</hi>

                  <p>He was beſides very Learned, he had been long while Profeſſor in Divinity, his Life had been alwayes exemplary, and he had been, as <hi>Aaron,</hi> called to all the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, through which he paſſed, as well as to that of Sovereign Pontiffe; he was born poor, he loved the poor, and Poverty; the Hereticks as well as the Catholicks did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge theſe his Virtues; but for all that, ſays our Cardinal-Hiſtorian, he was a very ordinary Pope, <hi>mà in verità mediocre

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis the moſt eſſential point of all Policy, to diſcern if the form be proportionate to the diſpoſitions of the matter, that is to ſay, if Laws carry an agreeableneſs to the guſt and inclinations of People for Times, Places, and other neceſſary Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Here is for example, a Maxim of <hi>Cheregat, Adrian</hi>'s Nuncio at the Diet of <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> that evil ought not to be admitted that good may come thereof,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>non doverſi tolerare i mali affinche ne vengan i beni.</hi> This Maxim taken thus univerſally, is not true; it appears by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31834:39"/>
the permiſſion that is given to lewd women to exerciſe their commerce in quiet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bodies being ſuffered to trouble them,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>come ſi vide nella permiſſione delle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrici:</hi> In effect, this Maxim is not true, but in caſe where the permiſſion of ſome ill would cauſe a greater ill than would come by puniſhing it; but on the contrary, when one is willing to ſtop an evil, and a greater would come of it, aſſuredly one ought to tolerate it; ſo that one of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant points of Religious Policy is to diſcern between the evils of the Abuſes, which ought to be quaſhed, from thoſe which ought to be ſuffered; as for example, diſhoneſt and lewd women are ſuffered by the Rules of the fleſhly Religious Policy. But as in occaſions, where things ſeeming alike are to be deliberated, mens ſentiments differ, and they are fertil in apparent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of one ſide and the other,<note place="margin">

                  <p>THe firſt pernicious Error of the zealous Ignorants is, to pretend that one ſhould live in the Church as one ought to live according to God, and that the Laws of the Church were regulated and formed by that Principle.</p>
                  <p>The contrary Maxim is, that the Laws of the Church ought to guide men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh, and commodiouſly having regard to the corrupt inclinations of their Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Second pernicious Error is, That that which is beſt to be done, is beſt alſo to be commanded.</p>
                  <p>The oppoſite Maxim is, That the beſt to be commanded, is that which can be done commodiouſly according to the Fleſh, and not that which ſhould be the beſt to be done according to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:31834:41"/>The Third pernicious Error of the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ignorants is, That the Church ought to be governed according to the Rules of Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>The oppoſite Maxim is. That the Church ought not to be governed according to the Rules of Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth pernicious Error is, That the Church ought to he governed by the way of Councils.</p>
                  <p>The oppoſite Maxim is, That the Church ought not to be governed by the way of Councils.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Error is, That the Church ought to be governed by every Biſhop in particular, according to the portion of the Epiſcopacy fallen to him, which makes in all the Biſhops but one and the ſame Unity of Epiſcopacy <hi>in ſolidum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fifth oppoſite Maxim is, That this Opinion is ſeditious, and that the Church ought to be governed by one only Biſhop, King and Monarch of all others.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, quoth the Cardinal, if one would take the meaſure of Good from the <hi>Idea</hi> of what it ought to be, the Church in the condition wherein we ſee her, would appear moſt dreadfully deformed,<note place="margin">Introd. c. <hi>8.</hi>

                  <p>They will not by any means that things ſhould rather be regulated according to that, which one man can in reaſon no more but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the times wherein we are, who are as it were, the Dregs of <hi>Adam's</hi> corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where our Republick to be governed, is not compoſed of any that be perfect, but of ſo many Millions of the imperfect Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the old and new world,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                  <p>The true <hi>Religious Policy,</hi> according to this Cardinal, doth lay it then for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Maxim, that for to make Laws, one ſhould be guided by the diſpoſition of the people, who being imperfect, ought to be regulated according as God and Nature hath ſet them into the world in theſe our times,<note place="margin">

upon what ought to be, having rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, <hi>dignè Deo,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks; From hence this Cardinal leaves it to be concluded, that the Laws of the Church ought not to be ſuch as they ſhould be: for example, if one were obliged to love God by an Act of Love, as a Divine Virtue; if one were obliged to tend to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Love, if one were curſed, doing the work of the Lord negligently.<note place="margin">Intr. l. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> This is ignorant Folks Zeal, <hi>zelo imperito d'alcuni,</hi> to confound what's beſt to be done, with what's beſt to be ordained, as if one was the other,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>che confondono l'ottimo à farſi con l'ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo à commandarſi,</hi> not perceiving that Laws are then worſt when they preſcribe what's moſt excellent, that is to ſay, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection impoſſible,<note place="margin">

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, though even one ſhould have hope enough of ſucceſs, yet before Laws be ſtabliſhed, 'tis prudence firſt to try and ſee what may be grateful to the generality of the World, in caſe ones Laws ſhould take effect, <hi>talora è prudenza il tentare eziandio con dubio dell'evento chiò che ſe riuſciſſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebbe grato al commune.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>So that the Rule to be given for making of Laws, is the diſpoſition of the people to receive them; otherwiſe if they be not grateful to them, it would be Ignorance and indiſcreet Zeal to offer violence to corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature.</p>

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:31834:43"/>Now to judge of the inclinations of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we ought not to conſider thoſe which they would have had if their nature had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſound, but thoſe which they have, their nature being corrupted by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, <hi>in queſta feccia d'Adamo.</hi>

Laws thereunto; This is the very Cardinal's conſequence. If one would ſeek the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, 'tis viſible there can be no other but that corrupted nature in purſuance of this ſame horror, this ſame ſhame, and this ſame dread of Poverty will ſeek for to enrich it ſelf, and ſuch ſeeking is a great virtue; for that every Act that ſerves to a man's Felicity, is an act of Virtue; ſo that corrupted Nature will ſhun Idleneſs, which is a ſin contrary to the carnal Felicity of the Chriſtian Republik, which cauſes even the rich to fall into poverty, which is oppoſite to their Felicity; whereas, if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on the contrary, ſhould teach people that labour and pains-taking, far off from being dreaded, is a thing enjoined, even to be done by the rich, that poverty, far off from being a ſtate of it ſelf ſhameful, is the firſt of the Chriſtian Beatitudes, as our Lord hath preached in his Goſpel; this ſame Belief would at leaſt render the man indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, both in regard of Riches and of Poverty, and falling into poverty, he would believe himſelf happy in that ſtate of Humiliation that Jeſus Chriſt choſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo that fear, horror and ſhame would not oblige him any more to labour to ſhun poverty, and get riches; that Chriſtian and Spiritual indifferency would make him leſs eager to work, as well as to get more qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and leſs careful of the Morrow, which would not be profitable for the carnal Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Chriſtian Republick, nor by

                  <p>The ſame would come to paſs, if the greateſt portion of the Goods of the Church were employed for relief of the poor, and not to enrich Prieſts and Church-men; for what a thing would that be, that Nature-corrupted-men, as the poor be as well as others, ſhould find, when they came to be poor, ſuch great Eſtates and abundance ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon them?<note place="margin">

'Tis viſible, that if Chriſtian Religion ſhould eſtabliſh theſe Maxims, Chriſtians Lives would be a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Mortification, and all that eagerneſs which makes men buſtle to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, enrich themſelves, and enjoy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Felicity according to the Fleſh, would

No, ſhe will accommodate her ſelf to that natural inclination of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bring it ſo to paſs, that there ſhall be more pleaſure in the Shews ſhe ſets forth for Chriſtians, than ever were in the Pagan Shews: Here is that called true Religious Policy according to the Fleſh, to cure the love of Pleaſure by beſtowing more carnal pleaſure upon a man within the Church, than one ſhould have had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of its Communion.

This was alſo one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors made at the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> to wit, That that, and former Councils Orders might exactly be obſerved without being infringed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations: This was a requeſt, quoth the Cardinal, that tended to no leſs than to undermine the Churches Monarchy,<note place="margin">

                  <p>'Tis very eaſie to make the Poiſon of this Error manifeſt, That what is the beſt to be done, is the beſt to be commanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one conſiders it in relation to Divine Laws, that direct the inward affections of the heart, or whether one conſiders it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Humane Laws of the Church, which can but direct exterior actions, it is wholly throughout pernicious. As for the inward Affections, God being the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Good of man, it is certain, that to love him by an act of Love, as a Virtue Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, would be the beſt; as alſo to ſet ones affection more upon that inviſible Good, than upon that which is ſeen; but is it beſt to ſay, that God hath thus commanded it?

Likewiſe to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and endeavour to arrive to a perfect actual Love of God, would aſſuredly be beſt; but would it be beſt to preach that men are thereunto obliged by Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? No, without doubt, by the ſame reaſon of this ſame Cardinal: ſo, to ſay, that he which does the work of God negligently is curſed; one ſees clearly the venom of ſuch like Doctrine, and how many perſons it would caſt into deſpair; here's what regards the Divine Laws, which regulate the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and affections of the inward man.</p>
                  <p>As to the humane Laws of the Church, which can regulate but outward actions, ſuppoſe one ſhould make a Law obliging Chriſtians to obſerve all the Canons indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, as the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> hath done, in theſe terms, <hi>Sciant <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi ſacratiſſimos Canones exactè ab omnibus &amp; quoad ejus fieri poterit, indiſtinctè obſervandos;</hi> Seſſ. 25. c. 18. There is no doubt but it is beſt to obſerve all the Canons; but is it beſt to command it? No, becauſe that that Law would take away from the Princes of the Church the power to derogate from thoſe Canons, and to ſhew favour therein to thoſe whom they ſhould judge fit,<note place="margin">

that he can have: to vitiate and ruine this Quality, by taking that power from him, is moſt pernicious, <hi>il peſſimo ſuole eſſere una corruzione dell'ottimo;</hi> ſo that it is alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in this reſpect, that it is a moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Error, That the beſt to be done, is the beſt to be commanded.</p>
                  <p>This may be remarked in the Laws made by the <hi>Council of Trent;</hi> for if the Pope ſhould obſerve them, and not ſhew favour when he judges it fit, the Spring of at leaſt half his Graces and Benefits would be at a ſtop,<note place="margin">Intr. c. <hi>10.</hi>

                  <p>I Believe in truth, quoth our Cardinal-Hiſtorian, That the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> dreaded and abhorred a Council, when that of <hi>Trent</hi> was propoſed to be Aſſembled,<note place="margin">Intr. c. <hi>10.</hi>

                  <p>And beſides, there would not come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of any conſiderable Good; for 'tis clear the Reformation eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> is very moderate,<note place="margin">Intr. c. <hi>10.</hi>

                  <p>Nevertheleſs, if the Pope ſhould obſerve ſtrictly this moderate Council, all would be loſt; this troubled <hi>Alexander</hi> VII, at his coming to the Popedom; for at that time he was very zealous and deſirous to re-eſtabliſh Diſcipline, and retrench Abuſes, he called to Council the ableſt men of the Dattery, <hi>periti delle facende della Dateria,</hi> and ſpeaking to them about the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Marriages within the prohibited Degrees, which were granted ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt the expreſs Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Council of Trent;</hi> he told them, he wondred much at ſo frequent a going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Deciſions of the Council, asking them how it could poſſibly be that it had ſo paſſed into a Cuſtom,<note place="margin">

Thus the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Trent,</hi> for all its Prudence and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſuffered it ſelf to be carried too far away with its Zeal, and went too far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Ideal Reformation, whereof miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous inconveniences might have followed, if the Prudence of the Popes had not brought a Cure. What can be hoped for then from all the other Councils wherein there was never found ſo much Prudence and Moderation, as appeared in this laſt Council?</p>
                  <p>There be a-many other Articles beſides that of Marriage, wherein there is need that the Pope ſhould give eaſe againſt

                  <p>In fine, The <hi>Council of Trent</hi> declared, That all the World was obliged to obſerve its Canons indiſtinctly, and that none ſhould be diſpenſed with, but when there was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and juſt cauſe, <hi>urgens juſtaque ratio;</hi> and then the Diſpenſation ſhould be given freely <hi>gratis,</hi> otherwiſe the ſame ſhould be null: <hi>Aliterque facta diſpenſatio ſubreptitia cenſeatur, Seſſ.</hi> 25. <hi>c.</hi> 18.

                  <p>THe beſt one can ſay of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> is, That it had the Prudence to inſert in its Decrees beginning and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That it meant in all things, that the Authority of the Apoſtolick See ſhould remain inviolate,<note place="margin">

After this faſhion is it, that our Cardinal, maintaining, That the Church ought not to be governed by way of Councils, and that, That of <hi>Trent</hi> hath upheld the Pope in an Authority over its own, doth defend the Judgment of the

                     <p>There is a deal of difference between the largeneſs of the Pope's Power, and the Power of Biſhops: The Pope, who is choſen, is ordinarily pious and ſage, <hi>ordinaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente ſuole eleggerſi pio e ſavio;</hi> he has remorſe of Conſcience, <hi>hai rimorſi della coſcienza;</hi> he has Sentiments of honour, <hi>e dell'honore;</hi> which being ſo, 'tis a leſs evil, as it may ſometimes happen, though ſome of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands be unreaſonable; which is ſeldom, and his Subjects be obliged to obey them, <hi>poſſa tal'ora obligare i ſoggetti exandio con qualche irragionevole ordinazione,</hi> than that he not being Prince and Monarch, as he is of all Biſhops, who are his Subjects, ſhould be made ſubject to their over-looking, and to their paſſionate Votes and Judgments, to which they are ſo ſubject.</p>

                     <p>But the great Reaſon which decides the Queſtion beyond Reply, and makes the Juggle of the contrary Opinion appear, is, That in effect, if the Biſhop's Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were of Divine Right, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged not to obey the Pope, when his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are not grounded upon juſt cauſe: they could not uſe the Diſpenſations which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31834:65"/>
he gives them, when they are not granted after the manner preſcribed by the Canons; for the Canons do forbid plurality of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices; it confounds, quoth the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> the Church-Order, that one perſon alone ſhould take upon him the Offices of many perſons.

Indeed the number of this ſort of Poor is not great, and of Ten Poor, it may be there is not one which is not Poor, for the puniſhment of his ſin; but yet at laſt ſome ſuch vertuous Poor there are, how ſmall ſoever their number be: 'tis then neceſſary to caſt forth this Maxime,

                  </q> Whereby it does yet again appear that our Cardinal does admit a Fortune diſtinct from divine Providence, as it hath been explained to us in the Politick conſideration upon

Fortune; For he would not ſay that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence had no ſhare in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> VII.

But what ſhall I ſay of your Holineſſes Nephews and near kindred, which you have left a whole year together at a diſtance from you, to try them before you called them to the Participation which they ought to have in the government (and the carnal Felicity of his reign.) To be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a whole year together from the top of the perfection (and the carnal felicity of the Church) what a tryal! What a long time for a principal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, ſo learned, of ſo ripe a Wit and of an integrety of life (ſo worthy of all the Eccleſiaſtical and religious vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs of the Roman Court) ſo known as was then the life of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Chigi,</hi> your Holineſſe's principal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, which you called to you for the ſolace rather then the burthen of the people.

this wicked raillery, and makes a Scholaſtick interpretation thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt at the Council, one needs not be an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to ſtare out the truth of it; even a mole it ſelf, either may ſee it, or ſmell it out, <hi>non ſi richiede eſſer Aquila, baſta non eſſer talpa.</hi> Herein alſo moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appears the infinite uſefulneſs of School divinity, the incomparable fruit that our Cardinal hath gathered, having been a Maſter ſo long therein as well as in Philoſophy according to <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> principles, that the Heriticks cannot frame any conceit how ridiculous ſoever it be, but that this Cardinal's Subtility meditating a little profoundly thereupon, can give as ſerious and as ſurpriſing an interpretation thereof by force of his good ſence, and reaſons far fetch't, as the hereticks thought to make uſe of to ſurpriſe ſimple folk with, by their wicked raillerie.
